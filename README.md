## Description on how to use the app

- This page will allow you to read actual information about any country you wish to read about.
- On the top page, there are eight initial countries. You can hover over and interact with them.
- Once you click on one of the images, the APIs get triggered giving you brief social-political information about the country as well as the weather and some history. Some of the countries will have background music also.
- If you wish to find another country that is not on the initial list, you could search for it in the search box.
- Once the country you wish to find gets submitted, the APIs will get triggered and display the same information.

## App Design Note

- The App gets the value "name" to access the first API. Once the information gets retrieved, it gets the coordinates from that particular country to trigger the weather API. Lastly, the Wikipedia API gets accessed with the value "name" that is used as the parameter to retrive a few paragraphs about the history of that country.
